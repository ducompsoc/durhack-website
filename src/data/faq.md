## What is DurHack 2019?
November 2019 marks the fourth iteration of DurHack, Durham University Computing Society's flagship annual hackathon. 150 students from Durham and around the country will come together in teams of four or five for a weekend-long invention marathon to create, innovate, learn and collaborate. We'll also provide loads of freebies, prizes, workshops and entertainment!
## Can I attend?
Anybody who is over 18 and a current registered student, or who has graduated after 23rd November 2018, can attend. Your degree subject doesn't matter, all you need is a passion for learning!  
DurHack is completely free to attend, and could not run without the generosity of our sponsors. We provide the space, WiFi, meals, snacks, and free swag. 
## When will tickets be released?
Tickets are available now! You can [register](https://ducompsoc.typeform.com/to/Zc4X5W) to attend.
## Do I need to be able to code to attend DurHack?
The most important thing when attending a hackathon is your enthusiasm for technology. DurHack is passionate about being very welcoming and beginner-friendly, and you'll learn loads at the event!  
If you want to learn to code but don't know where to start, you should definitely [read this blogpost](https://medium.com/on-coding/you-can-already-code-you-just-dont-know-it-yet-862044601a5a).  
We'll also be running several lead-up workshops with [CompSoc](https://compsoc.tech/) to prepare people for DurHack.
## Should I attend DurHack?
If you've thought at all about attending DurHack, yes! DurHack is welcoming to people of all abilities, all that's important is a willingness to get stuck in with your team. DurHack is designed to have an inclusive and encouraging environment, so don't be afraid to ask anyone for help at the event!
## What can I eat?
We'll provide you with meals, snacks and drinks throughout the weekend, leaving you to concentrate on your projects. If you have special dietary requirements, please let us know when you register.
## What should I bring?
All attendees will need to show valid student ID (other photo ID is acceptable for graduates) at registration. You'll also need a laptop and a charger, and you might want to bring a sleeping bag and toiletries.
## Can I get a visa invitation letter?
Yes! While we can't provide specific information about the visa application process for the UK, drop us an email at [hello@durhack.com](mailto:hello@durhack.com) and we can produce a visa invitation letter for you. 
## What if I don't have a team?
Don't worry! Part of the fun of a hackathon is meeting new people. We'll have a team-building event before hacking begins for those who want to meet and form new teams.
## Can I take a break overnight?
You'll have 24 hours to create your project. It's important to take regular breaks, and that's why we'll be providing a relaxation room for attendees to have a rest if they want. Part of the fun of the hackathon is coding through the night!
## What can I build and who owns the IP?
Web apps, mobile apps, hardware, anything! Projects will be judged based on their creativity, technical accomplishments, polish and usefulness by our judges.   
**The IP of your work remains with you, the attendees.**
## Do you have a code of conduct?
Everybody at DurHack 2019 will be expected to abide by the [MLH Code of Conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf).  
TL;DR: be respectful to each other.
## Do you offer travel reimbursements?
We know that hackers like you might be travelling from afar. We'd love to see you at DurHack this year and welcome you to our community. Unfortunately, we can't commit to offering any travel reimbursements right now.  
We'll let you know if this changes â€“ [pre-register](https://ducompsoc.typeform.com/to/eXzKfq) so we can get in touch! 
## What if I have other questions?
DurHack is an MLH Member Event. You should take a look at the [MLH FAQs](https://mlh.io/faq) for more answers to your questions.

If you're still not sure about something, drop us a line at [hello@durhack.com](mailto:hello@durhack.com) and we'll be very happy to help!
