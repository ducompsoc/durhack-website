## What is DurHack 2018?
November 2018 marks the third iteration of DurHack, Durham University Computing Society's flagship annual hackathon. 150 students from Durham and around the country will come together in teams of four for a weekend-long programming competition full of freebies, prizes, workshops and entertainment.
## Can I attend?
Anybody who is over 18 and a current registered student, or who has graduated after 18th November 2017, can attend. Your degree subject doesn't matter, but your team's programming skills will be tested!
## Does DurHack cost to attend?
DurHack is completely free to attend, and could not run without the generosity of our sponsors. We provide the space, WiFi, meals, snacks, and free swag. 
## When will tickets be released?
Tickets will be released in batches, starting in September/October 2018. [Pre-register](http://preregister.durhack.com) now to be the first to hear when tickets are released!
## What can I eat?
We'll provide you with meals, snacks and drinks throughout the weekend, leaving you to concentrate on your projects. If you have special dietary requirements, please let us know when you register.
## What should I bring?
All attendees will need to show valid student ID (other photo ID is acceptable for graduates) at registration. You'll also need a laptop and a charger, and you might want to bring a sleeping bag and toiletries.
## How big can teams be?
Teams of up to four are eligible for prizes. You can also hack solo if you prefer!
## What if I don't have a team?
Don't worry! Part of the fun of a hackathon is meeting new people. We'll have a team-building event before hacking begins for those who want to meet and form new teams.
## Can I take a break overnight?
You'll have 24 hours to create your project. It's important to take regular breaks, and that's why we'll be providing a relaxation room for attendees to have a rest if they want. Part of the fun of the hackathon is coding through the night!
## What can I build and who owns the IP?
Web apps, mobile apps, hardware, anything! Projects will be judged based on their creativity, technical accomplishments, polish and usefulness by our judges.   
**The IP of your work remains with you, the attendees.**
## Do you have a code of conduct?
Everybody at DurHack 2018 will be expected to abide by the [MLH code of conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf).  
TL;DR: be respectful of each other.
## Where is DurHack taking place?
The main event will be taking place in the Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University, whereas meals will be served in the Calman Learning Centre. The buildings will be clearly sign-posted.  
If you're travelling to Durham by train, it's either a 25-minute walk from the station to our venue, or a short ride on the number **6**, **56**, **57**, **57A** or **X12** bus from the bus station to the Science Site.
