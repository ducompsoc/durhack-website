			<h3>What is a Hackathon?</h3>
			<p>Hackathons are a playground for coders, inventors and tinkerers - We give you 24 hours to brainstorm and create something new, an original idea, or proof of concept of literally anything. Perhaps the next 
			killer app, a cutting edge hardware project or something different entirely! At the end, prizes will be awarded to the best and most original ideas.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-question">
			<h3>Who can come?</h3>
			<p>Durhack is run by students, for students, so you must be currently in full time education, and be 18 or older in order to attend. Please bring your student card when you come!</p>

		<div class="faq-question">
			<h3>How do I sign up?</h3>
			<p>Our tickets are managed through Eventbrite. Currently we haven't released any tickets, but we will be soon! If you want to hear about when we release tickets, then sign up to get
			notifications <a href="#">here.</a></p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-question">
			<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
			<p>You'll need to bring your ticket, a Student ID and a laptop (with a charger!). You could also bring a pillow or sleeping stuff if you want to get some rest overnight.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-question">
			<h3>How much is it?</h3>
			<p>Durhack is FREE! We are kindly funded by our sponsors. We will provide food, power and t-shirts and you shouldn't have to spend a penny once you're here. Currently, we do not know
			if we are able to provide travel reimbursements as the budget has not been finalised, so please negotiate your own travel to the venue.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-question">
			<h3>Help! I don't have a team!</h3>
			<p>If you don't have a team then don't worry, there will be an icebreaking event at the start of the hack where you can pitch ideas to others, or be pitched to and help build a great idea.
			We also welcome people wishing to hack solo as well.</p>
